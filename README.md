# CO₂ Emissions Calculator

A modern web application that calculates CO₂ emissions from utility usage (electricity, natural gas, and water) and provides personalized recommendations for reducing environmental impact.

## Features

- **📍 Location-Based Calculations**: Uses ZIP code to determine regional emission factors
- **⚡ Multi-Utility Support**: Track electricity, natural gas, and water usage
- **📊 Interactive Visualizations**: Charts and graphs showing emission breakdowns and trends
- **🏘️ Regional Comparisons**: Compare your emissions to regional averages
- **💡 Personalized Recommendations**: Get tailored tips to reduce emissions and save money
- **📈 Historical Tracking**: Monitor your emissions over time
- **🎨 Modern UI**: Sleek, responsive design with smooth animations

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **State Management**: React Context + useReducer

## Architecture

The application is built with a highly modular architecture for easy collaboration:
